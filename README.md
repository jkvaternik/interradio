# interradio
Interradio is a Java-based desktop application that Alex Radovan and I co-developed for our first semester project in AP Computer Science. It is an international radio player that uses audio URL streams to play radio programs from several countries in different continents.


NOTE: Although this project was added to Github on 12/09/2019, the project was created and not modified since 2017.
